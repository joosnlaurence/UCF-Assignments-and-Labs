// Table : Abstract data type that stores records according to search key values (sounds like a dictionary)
// Each individual row in a table is its own record
// Direct Access Table: Directly insert, access, or delete the values that you want by treating some
// unique value as an index -> very bad for storage
// Instead, we could try to map the unique IDs to some sort of number
// Introducing, the hash table!
// An array of table items, where the index is calculated by inputting the key into a hash function
// A good hash function avoids collisions, is fast, and distributes items evenly (i.e. calculated indices don't 
//  cluster around some group of values)
